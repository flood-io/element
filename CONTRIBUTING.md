4. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request](https://help.github.com/en/articles/creating-a-pull-request)
5. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be reviewed and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:
