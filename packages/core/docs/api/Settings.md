# `TestSettings`

The TestSettings interface specifies the available settings you have to configure how your test runs. These properties should be exported using the property `settings`.

**Example:**

```typescript
export const settings: TestSettings = {
  loopCount: Infinity,
  clearCache: true
}
```

See [DEFAULT_SETTINGS] for a list of the default value for each setting.

#### properties
* `actionDelay` &lt;undefined | number&gt;  (Optional)   Specifies the time (in seconds) to wait between each action call.  
    
  Waiting between actions simulates the behaviour of a real user as they read, think and act on the page's content.  
    
* `blockedDomains` &lt;string\[]&gt;  (Optional)   Blocks requests to a list a domains. Accepts partial matches using `*` or any matcher accepted by [Micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch)  
    
  Matching is applied to the `hostname` only, unless the blocked domain contains a `:` in which case it will match against `hostname` and `port`.  
    
  Example:  
    
  `["*.google-analytics.com", "*:1337"]`  
    
* `chromeVersion` &lt;[ChromeVersion]&gt;  (Optional)   Specifies a version of Google Chrome  
* `clearCache` &lt;undefined | false | true&gt;  (Optional)   Specifies whether Browser cache should be cleared after each test loop.  
* `clearCookies` &lt;undefined | false | true&gt;  (Optional)   Specifies whether cookies should be cleared after each test loop.  
* `consoleFilter` &lt;[ConsoleMethod]\[]&gt;  (Optional)   Specify which console methods to filter out. By default no console methods are filtered.  
    
  This setting can be useful for very noisy tests. When a method is filtered, it still works as normal but the message will be omitted from the Element output.  
    
* `description` &lt;undefined | string&gt;  (Optional)   Speicifies the description of the test specified in the comments section  
* `device` &lt;undefined | string&gt;  (Optional)   Specifies a device to emulate with browser device emulation.  
* `disableCache` &lt;undefined | false | true&gt;  (Optional)   Disables browser request cache for all requests.  
* `duration` &lt;undefined | number&gt;  (Optional)   Maximum duration to run the test for.  
    
  Note that when running a load test via https://flood.io, the duration of the load test takes precedence over this setting.  
    
  Defaults to `-1` for no timeout.  
    
* `extraHTTPHeaders` &lt;undefined | unknown reflection type&gt;  (Optional)   Specifies a set of extra HTTP headers to set before each test loop.  
  If this setting is undefined, the extra HTTP headers are left as-is between iterations.  
* `ignoreHTTPSErrors` &lt;undefined | false | true&gt;  (Optional)   Whether to ignore HTTPS errors during navigation. Defaults to `false`  
* `incognito` &lt;undefined | false | true&gt;  (Optional)   Controls whether each iteration should run within an Incognito window instead of a normal  
  window. The Incognito session will be destroyed between each loop.  
* `loopCount` &lt;undefined | number&gt;  (Optional)   Number of times to run this test.  
    
  Defaults to `-1` for an unlimited number of loops.  
    
* `name` &lt;undefined | string&gt;  (Optional)   Speicifies the name of the test specified in the comments section  
* `responseTimeMeasurement` &lt;[ResponseTiming]&gt;  (Optional)   Configures how we record response time for each step.  
    
  Possible values:  
  - `"page"`: Record the document loading response time. This is usually what you consider response time on paged web apps.  
  - `"network"`: Takes the mean response time of all network requests which occur during a step. This is useful for Single Page Application which don't actually trigger a navigation.  
  - `"step"`: (Default) Records the wall clock time of a step. This is useful for Single Page Application which don't actually trigger a navigation.  
  - `"stepWithThinkTime"`: Records the wall clock time of a step including `actionDelay` time.  
    
* `screenshotOnFailure` &lt;undefined | false | true&gt;  (Optional)   Take a screenshot of the page when a command fails, to aid in debugging.  
    
  Screenshots are saved to `/flood/result/screenshots` in the test archive.  
    
* `stepDelay` &lt;undefined | number&gt;  (Optional)   Specifies the time (in seconds) to wait after each step.  
* `userAgent` &lt;undefined | string&gt;  (Optional)   Specifies a custom User Agent (UA) string to send.  
* `waitTimeout` &lt;undefined | number&gt;  (Optional)   Global wait timeout applied to all wait tasks.  
* `waitUntil` &lt;[ElementPresence]&gt;  (Optional)     
## `ConsoleMethod`
Specifies a `console` method

```typescript
"log" | "info" | "debug" | "warn" | "error"
```
## `ResponseTiming`
Specifies a method for recording response times.

literal | description
--------|------------
step | (Default) Records the wall clock time of a step. This is useful for Single Page Application which don't actually trigger a navigation.
page | Record the document loading response time. This is usually what you consider response time on paged web apps.
network | (Experimental) Takes the mean response time of all network requests which occur during a step. This is useful for Single Page Application which don't actually trigger a navigation.
stepWithThinkTime | `"stepWithThinkTime"`: Records the wall clock time of a step including `actionDelay` time.

```typescript
"page" | "network" | "step" | "stepWithThinkTime"
```
#### `setup(settings)`
* `settings` &lt;[TestSettings]&gt;   

* returns: &lt;void&gt; 

Declares the settings for the test, overriding the settings constant exported in the test script.

_This is a secondary syntax for `export const settings = {}` which functions exactly the same way._

**Example:**

```typescript
export default () => {
 setup({ waitTimeout: 60 })
}
```

# `DEFAULT_SETTINGS`
The default settings for a Test. Any settings you provide are merged into these defaults.
