The `TestSettings` is used to configure how you want Element to behave during a test run, including wait timing, timeouts, browser agent, window size, and much more.

Settings are specified by exporting a `const settings` from your test script, and loaded when your test script is first evaluated by the test runner.

**Example:**

```typescript
export const settings: TestSettings = {
  loopCount: Infinity,
  clearCache: true
}
```

See [DEFAULT SETTINGS](#default-settings) for a list of the default value for each setting.

## Setting Properties

### actionDelay

`number`  (Optional)   Specifies the time (in seconds) to wait between each action call.  

  Waiting between actions simulates the behaviour of a real user as they read, think and act on the page's content.  

### blockedDomains

`string\[]`  (Optional)   Blocks requests to a list a domains. Accepts partial matches using `*` or any matcher accepted by [Micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).

Matching is applied to the `hostname` only, unless the blocked domain contains a `:` in which case it will match against `hostname` and `port`.  

Example:  `["*.google-analytics.com", "*:1337"]`

### browser

Since Element 2.0, you can set the browser type used to run the test, either using one of the 3 browser types bundled with [Playwright](https://playwright.dev/), including `'chromium'`, `'firefox'` and `'webkit'` or using `'chrome'` installed on the machine. Defaults to `'chromium'`.

Note that using `'chrome'` only works if Google Chrome is installed in the default path:
- **On Windows:** C:/Program Files (x86)/GoogleChrome/Applicationchrome.exe
- **On MacOS:** /Applications/Google Chrome.app/Contents/MacOS/Google Chrome
- **On Flood Grid:** /usr/bin/google-chrome-stable

Otherwise, you need to specify the custom path with *executablePath* property in [browserLaunchOptions](#browserlaunchoptions) setting.

### browserLaunchOptions

`Object` (Optional) Sets additional launch options on the browser. This will allow you to specify a custom Chromium-based browser type used to run the test, like [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/edge) or [Brave](https://brave.com/), rather than the [3 bundled ones](#browser).

**Properties**

-   executablePath `string` path to the installation folder of a custom browser based on Chromium. If set, Element will ignore the [browser](#browser) settings, and use this custom browser instead.
-   downloadsPath `string` if specified, accepted downloads are downloaded into this directory. Otherwise, temporary directory is created and is deleted when browser is closed.
-   firefoxUserPrefs `Object` Firefox user preferences. Learn more about the Firefox user preferences [here](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/about-config-editor-firefox)
-   proxy `Object` Network proxy settings.
    -   server `string` Proxy to be used for all requests. HTTP and SOCKS proxies are supported, for example `http://myproxy.com:3128` or `socks5://myproxy.com:3128`. Short form `myproxy.com:3128` is considered an HTTP proxy.
    -   bypass `string` Optional coma-separated domains to bypass proxy, for example ".com, chromium.org, .domain.com".
    -   username `string` Optional username to use if HTTP proxy requires authentication.
    -   password `string` Optional password to use if HTTP proxy requires authentication.

```typescript
export const settings: TestSettings = {
	browserLaunchOption: {
		executablePath: '/Applications/Microsoft Edge.app/Contents/MacOS/Microsoft Edge',
	},
}
```

### ~~chromeVersion~~ (DEPRECATED since version 2.0)

~~`puppeteer` or `stable` (Optional)   Specifies a version of Google Chrome to run the test~~

This setting is no longer supported since version 2.0. Instead, you can use [browser](#browser) setting or *executablePath* property in [browserLaunchOptions](#browserlaunchoptions) setting to specify the target browser.

### clearCache

`false` \| `true`  (Optional)   Specifies whether Browser cache should be cleared after each test loop.  

### clearCookies

`false` \| `true`  (Optional)   Specifies whether cookies should be cleared after each test loop.  

### consoleFilter

[ConsoleMethod](#console-method)(Optional)   Specify which console methods to filter out. By default no console methods are filtered.  

This setting can be useful for very noisy tests. When a method is filtered, it still works as normal but the message will be omitted from the Element output.  

### description

`string`  (Optional)   Speicifies the description of the test specified in the comments section  

### device

`string`  (Optional)   Specifies a device to emulate with browser device emulation.  

### disableCache

`false` \| `true`  (Optional)   Disables browser request cache for all requests.  

### duration

`number`  (Optional)   Maximum duration to run the test for.  

  Note that when running a load test via [Flood](https://flood.io), the duration of the load test takes precedence over this setting.  

  Defaults to `-1` for no timeout.  

### extraHTTPHeaders

`Object` (Optional) Specifies a set of extra HTTP headers to set before each test loop.  
If this setting is undefined, the extra HTTP headers are left as-is between iterations.

```typescript
export const settings: TestSettings = {
	extraHTTPHeaders: { 'Accept-Language': 'en' },
}
```

### ignoreHTTPSErrors

`false` \| `true`  (Optional)   Whether to ignore HTTPS errors during navigation. Defaults to `false`  

### incognito

`false` \| `true`  (Optional)   Controls whether each iteration should run within an Incognito window instead of a normal  
  window. The Incognito session will be destroyed between each loop.  

### launchArgs

`string[]` Additional arguments to pass to the browser instance.
The list of Chromium flags can be found [here](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/)

### loopCount

`number`  (Optional)   Number of times to run this test.  

  Defaults to `-1` (or `Infinity`) for an unlimited number of loops.  

### name

`string`  (Optional)   Speicifies the name of the test specified in the comments section  

### responseTimeMeasurement

[ResponseTiming](#responsetiming)  (Optional)   Configures how we record response time for each step.  

  Possible values:  

-   `"page"`: Record the document loading response time. This is usually what you consider response time on paged web apps.  
-   `"network"`: Takes the mean response time of all network requests which occur during a step. This is useful for Single Page Application which don't actually trigger a navigation.  
-   `"step"`: (Default) Records the wall clock time of a step. This is useful for Single Page Application which don't actually trigger a navigation.  
-   `"stepWithThinkTime"`: Records the wall clock time of a step including `actionDelay` time.  

### screenshotOnFailure

`false` \| `true`  (Optional)   Take a screenshot of the page when a command fails, to aid in debugging.  

  Screenshots are saved to `/flood/result/screenshots` in the test archive.

### stages

  `Array`  (Optional) Since Element 2.0, you can specify the target number of Virtual Users (VUs), each running in a separate browser instance, to ramp up or down to for a specific period. This would be helpful for a local load test at a small scale.

  Note that this setting is only applicable when [running test scripts locally](cli#run-a-test-script-locally) with the option `--mu`.

  For example, the below settings would have Element ramp up from 1 to 5 VUs (browser instances) for 3 minutes, then stay flat at 5 VUs for 5 minutes, then continue to ramp up from 5 to 10 VUs over the next 10 minutes before finally ramp down to 3 VUs for another 3 minutes.

```typescript
export const settings: TestSettings = {
  stages: [
    { duration: '3m', target: 5 },
    { duration: '5m', target: 5 },
    { duration: '10m', target: 10 },
    { duration: '3m', target: 3 },
  ],
}
```

When running with multiple users locally, you will get a table which reports the load-testing metrics after the test finishes.

### stepDelay

  `number`  (Optional)   Specifies the time (in seconds) to wait after each step.  

### userAgent

`string`  (Optional)   Specifies a custom User Agent (UA) string to send.  

### viewport

`Object` Set the viewport with the below properties:

-   width `number` page width in pixels. Required.
-   height `number` page height in pixels. Required.
-   deviceScaleFactor `number` Specify device scale factor (can be thought of as dpr). Defaults to 1.
-   isMobile `boolean` Whether the meta viewport tag is taken into account. Defaults to `false`.
-   hasTouch `boolean` Specifies if viewport supports touch events. Defaults to `false`.
-   isLandscape `boolean` Specifies if viewport is in landscape mode. Defaults to `false`.

### waitTimeout

`number`  (Optional)   Global wait timeout applied to all wait tasks.  

### waitUntil : (Optional)

-   present: only checks for presence in the DOM
-   visible: waits until the element is visible on the page and is painted
-   ready: waits until the element is painted and not disabled

## Console Method

Specifies a `console` method

```typescript
"log" | "info" | "debug" | "warn" | "error"
```

## ResponseTiming

```

## setup(settings)

-   `settings` &lt;[TestSettings]>   

-   returns: &lt;void> 

Declares the settings for the test, overriding the settings constant exported in the test script.

_This is a secondary syntax for `export const settings = {}` which functions exactly the same way._

**Example:**

```typescript
export default () => {
  setup({ waitTimeout: 60 })
}
```

## DEFAULT SETTINGS
