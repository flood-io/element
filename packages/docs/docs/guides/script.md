title: Test steps
---

Element tests are defined as a series of steps, which are run in sequence. Unlike other functional testing tools which encourage step isolation, Element is about defining a user journey through an application as a series of steps.

During execution, the timing of each step can be measured so that you can profile the throughput and performance of specific sections of the user journey. Timing can be measured as wall clock time, network time, and subsets of each.

## Defining steps

You first need to import the step creator from the Element package:

```ts title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";
```

Each test must export a defualt suite, which is what Element will use to detect the steps to run:

```ts title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  ...
};
```

The next step is to define a list of steps using the step helper:

```ts title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step("Step 1", async () => {
    ...
  })

  step("Step 2", async () => {
    ...
  })

  step("Step 3", async () => {
    ...
  })

};
```

What we did here was defined 3 steps, giving each a descriptive title, and a callback function which will contain the actual business logic of our test, in the form of test actions.

## Defining test actions

A test without actions is pretty bare, so lets instruct the browser to navigate to a page:

```diff title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step("Step 1", async (browser) => {
+   await browser.visit("https://google.com")
  })
};
```

You'll notice that we pulled the `browser` from the first argument received by the callback function. You also have access to the current `row` of test data if you've specified a test data service.

The browser exposes every action avaialable to you at a top level for interacting with the page. See the [Browser API](api/Browser.md) page for a complete list.

## Handling failure

A test step can fail for a number of reasons, most commonly though it will be because the state of the page wasn't as you expected it to be, which might in turn be because the application is overloaded, an error message is shown, or the inventory of stock you're testing against is exhausted.

Handling failures is part of building a robust performance test suite. Element provides a number of methods for this:

### Recovery steps

Recovery steps define an optional step which is called if a previous step fails, and can then perform a series of actions to return the application to a known state.

There are two types of recovery steps: global and local.

**Global recovery**

```diff title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step("Step 1", async (browser) => {
   await browser.visit("https://google.com")
  })

+  step.recovery(async browser => {
+    let alertCloser = await browser.findElement(By.id("close"))
+    if (alertCloser!=null) await alertCloser.click()
+  })
};
```

**Local recovery**

```diff title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step("Step 1", async (browser) => {
   await browser.visit("https://google.com")
  })

-  step.recovery(async browser => {
+  step.recovery("Step 1", async browser => {
+    let alertCloser = await browser.findElement(By.id("close"))
+    if (alertCloser!=null) await alertCloser.click()
+  })
};
```

**Recovery instructions**

Element offers the ability to control what happens after a step has been recovered:

By returning one of these instructions, the test will change its course:

- `RecoverWith.RETRY`: Retry the previous step again. Element will only do this to `recoveryTries` count, which takes `1` as the default value. You can apply a general value for the whole test by putting this option within the `TestSettings`, or even override this value for a specific step by putting it into the recovery step as in the code snippet below.
- `RecoverWith.CONTINUE`: Continue to the next step. This is the default behaviour.
- `RecoverWith.RESTART`: Exit this loop and restart the test at the beginning, resetting the browser in the process.

```ts title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step("Step 1", async (browser) => {
    await browser.visit("https://google.com");
  });

  step.recovery("Step 1", { recoveryTries: 2 }, async (browser) => {
    let alertCloser = await browser.findElement(By.id("close"));
    if (alertCloser != null) await alertCloser.click();

    return RecoverWith.RETRY; // retry "Step 1"
  });
};
```

### Try/Catch

Because Element scripts are JavaScript, you can use any error handling you typically would in JS, including `try/catch` or `.catch(...)`.

```diff title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step("Step 1", async (browser) => {
   await browser.visit("https://google.com")

+   try {
+     // maybe do something here
+   }catch {
+    // recover here
+   }
})
};
```

### Which recovery method to use?

Deciding on which recovery method to use depends on whether you want the recovery time measured separately from the step you were testing.

Using `try/catch` will include the catch time in the total time because Element isn't aware of the time you're spending on this step.

Using a recovery step will measure the time separately as "Step 1 (Recovery)"

## Conditional steps
Flood Element supports conditional execution. If you want to execute a specific chain of actions only when a condition is satisfied, you can do so using either `step.if()` or `step.unless()`.

### step.if()
Executed only when a condition is met
```ts title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step.if(condition, 'Step name', async browser => {
     // do something
})
};
```

### step.unless()
Executed only when a the opposite of a condition is met
```ts title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step.unless(condition, 'Step name', async browser => {
     // do something
})
};
```

## Repeatable steps
In case you want a step to run repeatedly for several times, or keep running while a condition is still true, you can do so using `step.repeat()` or `step.while()`

### step.repeat()
Repeat a step for a pre-defined number of times
```ts title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step.repeat(number, 'Step name', async browser => {
     // do something
})
};
```

### step.while()
Repeat a step while a condition is still true
```ts title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step.while(condition, 'Step name', async browser => {
     // do something
})
};
```

## Run a step once off
For some specific steps like `authentication`, you might want to run only once in the whole test, regardless of how many times you test will iterate. In that case, `step.once()` is what you need.

```ts title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step.once('Step name', async browser => {
     // do something
})
};
```

## Mark a step as `skipped`
Use `step.skip()` to skip the execution of a step in your test. 
```ts title="my-test.perf.ts"
import { step } from "@flood/element";

export default () => {
  step.skip('Step name', async browser => {
     // do something
})
};
