Variables are used to store information to be referenced and manipulated in test scripts. You can declare variables, and then use their values in [actions][edit-action] and [assertions][assert].

Element Recorder supports two types of variables:

* **Manual variables:** Ordinary variables that you will manually assign values to.

* **Variables from element property:** Variables whose values are extracted from element's properties. This is helpful when you don't want to "hard-code" a value for a variable but rather keep it dynamic by obtaining the value from an element's property every time the page loads.

You can also define the scope of the variables created as *global* or *step-scoped*.

* **Global variables:** declared at the beginning of the script and can be used across the whole test script.

* **Step-scoped variables:** declared in a [step][step] and can only be used within that step.

## Add a variable

To add a variable, on Recording screen, click `Variables`.

<img src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-variable.png')} alt="variable menu" width="250"/>

"Variables management" screen will appear. Click `Add variable`, then select `Manually` or `From element property` to add corresponding variable. See details in the sections below.

### Manually

After selecting to add a variable `Manually`, you will see "Create new variable" screen where you can edit the variable details.

<img src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-variable-add-manually.png')} alt="add variable manually" width="250"/>

* **Variable name**

  Enter a name for the variable which starts with a letter and contains no special characters other than underscore _.

* **Step-scoped variable**

  By default, variables created manually can be accessed anywhere in the test script. If selected, this variable will be accessible only within the standing step.

* **Data type**

  Allows you to select a data type. Supports `string`, `number`, and `bool`.

* **Value**

  Manually enter a value for the variable.

Once you've entered all the details, click `Done`. There will be a variable created in "Variables management" screen.

If you selected `Step-scoped variable` above, then a `CREATE` action will also be added to the Recording screen at the cursor.

### From element property

After selecting to add a variable `From element property`, you will be prompted to select an element on the page. When you hover on the page, there will be a purple box indicating the element you're about to choose. Click on the element to select.

"Create new variable" screen will appear and you can edit the variable details.

<img src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-variable-add-from-element-detail.png')} alt="add variable from element - details" width="250"/>

* **Variable name**

  Enter a name for the variable which starts with a letter and contains no special characters other than underscore _.

* **Selected element**

  * Supports switching between `CSS` and `XPATH` selector. By default, elements are selected using `CSS` selector. You can change this in the [Recorder settings][recorder-settings].

  * If you'd like to change the element to assert, click `Change` and select another element on the page.

* **Attribute/property to extract value**

  Allows you to select an attribute or property of the target element to assert. `innerText` is selected by default.

* **Regex to apply:**

  Allows you to use regular expression to extract only a part of the property's value selected above.
  
  For example, if you'd like to extract only the number part from the string *"Get up to 59% Off New Arrivals"* below for your variable `percentOff`, enter the regex "\d+".

  <img src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-variable-regex.png')} alt="regex" width="600"/>

* **Temporary value:**

  Pre-populated with the current value extracted from the selected property (regex applied - if specified). Note that this can be different every time the page loads.

Once you've entered all the details, click `Done`. There will be a variable created in "Variables management" screen.

<img src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-variable-added-2.png')} alt="manual variable added 2" width="250"/>

A `CREATE` action will also be added to the Recording screen at the cursor.

:::info NOTE

  * Variables created from element properties are always step-scoped and will be accessible only within the standing step.
  
  * Since values of variables created from element properties can be different every time the page loads, their value appear as `Dynamic value` instead of set-in-stone values.

## Edit a variable

There are two ways to edit a variable.

1. On Recording screen, hover on the `CREATE` action, then click `...` icon > `Edit variable`.

2. On "Variables management" screen, hover on the variable, then click `...` icon > `Edit variable`.

## Delete a variable

There are two ways to delete a variable.

1. On Recording screen, hover on the `CREATE` action, then click `x` icon.

2. On "Variables management" screen, hover on the variable, then click `x` icon.

:::info NOTE

You can only delete a variable if it is not in used in any actions or assertions. If you'd like to delete a variable that is in used in some actions, you will need to remove the variable usages from those actions first.

## Use variables

After creating variables, you can use them as values in [actions][edit-action] and [assertions][assert].

For example, to use variable in `Expected value` of an assertion:

1. Click on the field.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-variable-use-1.png')} alt="use variable 1" width="250"/>

2. Type double curly brackets `{{`. The list of declared variables that are applicable for this assertion (scope-wise) will appear.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-variable-use-2.png')} alt="use variable 2" width="250"/>

3. Select a variable from the list or continue typing to filter the list further.

  <img src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-variable-use-3.png')} alt="use variable 3" width="250"/>

  In this example, the current value of variable `h2_innerText` is *"Step 2"*. That's why you see *"Temporary value: Step 2"* below the field.

You can also combine string values with one or more variables to form a concatenated value. For example, *"{{username}} has a {{percentOff}}% discount code"*.
