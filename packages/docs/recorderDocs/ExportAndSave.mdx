When you're done recording a scenario, you can export it as an [Element][element] test script to refine with an editor later or save it to [Flood][flood] to initiate a load test.

Currently, the Recorder does not support saving the recorded scenario itself for future editing.

## Export a test script

To export a test script, on the Recording screen, click `Export` at the bottom.

<img src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-export.png')} alt="export" width="250" />

The recorded scenario, along with other [test settings][test-settings], will be exported as an Element test script (a `.ts` file) and downloaded to your machine.

To learn more about Element test scripts, see [Scripting in Element][scritpting-in-element].

## Save a test script to Flood

To save a test script to Flood to initiate a test:

1. On the Recording screen, click `Save to Flood` at the bottom.

{' '}

<img src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-save-to-flood.png')} alt="save to Flood" width="250" />

2. The Flood upload configuration page will be opened in a new tab and will prompt you to log in to [Flood][flood] first if you're not logged in.

{' '}

<img
	src={useBaseUrl('docs_img/rec-flood-select-project.png')}
	alt="select a flood project"
	width="600"
/>

On this page, you can configure the script uploading as below.

- Select a Flood project to upload the script to.

- Select "Create a new stream" or "Modify an existing stream". If you select "Modify an existing stream", you'll need to select a stream to add this script to.

- Edit the name of the generated script (.ts).

3. Click `Continue` to proceed to Flood test design and launch page. Here you can [design your test][design-test] and [launch your test on Flood][launch-test] with the uploaded script.
