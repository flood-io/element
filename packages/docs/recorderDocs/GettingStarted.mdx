## Overview

Element Recorder is a Chrome extension that helps you to record your interactions with websites and then generate an automation test script to initiate a load test on [Flood](https://flood.io). You can also export it as an Element test script for future maintanance. Element Recorder makes it easy to get acquainted with [Flood Element](https://element.flood.io) scripting. Features include:

* Recording tests on Chrome.
* Saving tests directly to Flood and initiate load tests.
* Exporting tests as Element scripts for later revising.

Element Recorder supports most of common user interactions on websites along with many helpful utilities like the ability to add explicit waits, taking screenshots, asserting or adding variables to test scenarios. Its ultimate goal is to help you automate functional tests or load tests with [Flood](https://flood.io) without the need to learn a test scripting language.

If there's something you'd like to do that isn't already covered in our documentation, contact us at [support@flood.io](mailto:support@flood.io) - we can help you figure it out. We also welcome any feedback or comments!
