title: 'Test Settings'
---

The `TestSettings` is used to configure how you want Element to behave during a test run, including wait timing, timeouts, browser agent, window size, and much more.

Settings are specified by exporting a `const settings` from your test script, and loaded when your test script is first evaluated by the test runner.

**Example:**

```typescript
export const settings: TestSettings = {
  loopCount: Infinity,
  clearCache: true
}
```

See [DEFAULT SETTINGS](#default-settings) for a list of the default value for each setting.

## Setting Properties
### actionDelay
`number`  (Optional)   Specifies the time (in seconds) to wait between each action call.  
    
  Waiting between actions simulates the behaviour of a real user as they read, think and act on the page's content.  
    
### blockedDomains 
`string\[]`  (Optional)   Blocks requests to a list a domains. Accepts partial matches using `*` or any matcher accepted by [Micromatch](https://github.com/micromatch/micromatch).
    
Matching is applied to the `hostname` only, unless the blocked domain contains a `:` in which case it will match against `hostname` and `port`.  

Example:  `["*.google-analytics.com", "*:1337"]`  
    
### chromeVersion
`puppeteer` or `stable` (Optional)   Specifies a version of Google Chrome to run the test
### clearCache
`false` | `true`  (Optional)   Specifies whether Browser cache should be cleared after each test loop.  
### clearCookies
`false` | `true`  (Optional)   Specifies whether cookies should be cleared after each test loop.  
### consoleFilter
[ConsoleMethod](#console-method)(Optional)   Specify which console methods to filter out. By default no console methods are filtered.  
    
This setting can be useful for very noisy tests. When a method is filtered, it still works as normal but the message will be omitted from the Element output.  
    
### description
`string`  (Optional)   Speicifies the description of the test specified in the comments section  
### device
`string`  (Optional)   Specifies a device to emulate with browser device emulation.  
### disableCache
`false` | `true`  (Optional)   Disables browser request cache for all requests.  
### duration
`number`  (Optional)   Maximum duration to run the test for.  
    
  Note that when running a load test via [Flood](https://flood.io), the duration of the load test takes precedence over this setting.  
    
  Defaults to `-1` for no timeout.  
    
### extraHTTPHeaders
&lt;undefined | unknown reflection type&gt;  (Optional)   Specifies a set of extra HTTP headers to set before each test loop.  
  If this setting is undefined, the extra HTTP headers are left as-is between iterations.  
### ignoreHTTPSErrors 
`false` | `true`  (Optional)   Whether to ignore HTTPS errors during navigation. Defaults to `false`  
### incognito 
`false` | `true`  (Optional)   Controls whether each iteration should run within an Incognito window instead of a normal  
  window. The Incognito session will be destroyed between each loop.  

### launchArgs
`string[]` Additional arguments to pass to the browser instance.
The list of Chromium flags can be found [here](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/)

### loopCount 
`number`  (Optional)   Number of times to run this test.  
    
  Defaults to `-1` (or `Infinity`) for an unlimited number of loops.  
    
### name 
`string`  (Optional)   Speicifies the name of the test specified in the comments section  
### responseTimeMeasurement 
[ResponseTiming](#responsetiming)  (Optional)   Configures how we record response time for each step.  
    
  Possible values:  
  - `"page"`: Record the document loading response time. This is usually what you consider response time on paged web apps.  
  - `"network"`: Takes the mean response time of all network requests which occur during a step. This is useful for Single Page Application which don't actually trigger a navigation.  
  - `"step"`: (Default) Records the wall clock time of a step. This is useful for Single Page Application which don't actually trigger a navigation.  
  - `"stepWithThinkTime"`: Records the wall clock time of a step including `actionDelay` time.  
    
### screenshotOnFailure
`false` | `true`  (Optional)   Take a screenshot of the page when a command fails, to aid in debugging.  
    
  Screenshots are saved to `/flood/result/screenshots` in the test archive.  
    
### stepDelay
 `number`  (Optional)   Specifies the time (in seconds) to wait after each step.  
### userAgent
`string`  (Optional)   Specifies a custom User Agent (UA) string to send.  
### waitTimeout
`number`  (Optional)   Global wait timeout applied to all wait tasks.  
### waitUntil : (Optional) 
  - present: only checks for presence in the DOM
  - visible: waits until the element is visible on the page and is painted
  - ready: waits until the element is painted and not disabled
## Console Method
Specifies a `console` method

```typescript
"log" | "info" | "debug" | "warn" | "error"
```
## ResponseTiming
Specifies a method for recording response times.

| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| step              | (Default) Records the wall clock time of a step. This is useful for Single Page Application which don't actually trigger a navigation.                                               |
| page              | Record the document loading response time. This is usually what you consider response time on paged web apps.                                                                        |
| network           | (Experimental) Takes the mean response time of all network requests which occur during a step. This is useful for Single Page Application which don't actually trigger a navigation. |
| stepWithThinkTime | `"stepWithThinkTime"`: Records the wall clock time of a step including `actionDelay` time.                                                                                           |

```typescript
"page" | "network" | "step" | "stepWithThinkTime"
```
## setup(settings)
* `settings` &lt;[TestSettings]&gt;   

* returns: &lt;void&gt; 

Declares the settings for the test, overriding the settings constant exported in the test script.

_This is a secondary syntax for `export const settings = {}` which functions exactly the same way._

**Example:**

```typescript
export default () => {
 setup({ waitTimeout: 60 })
}
```

## DEFAULT SETTINGS
The default settings for a Test. Any settings you provide are merged into these defaults.
