The Element Command Line Interface (CLI) is a powerful tool that makes it fast and easy to get started with browser level performance testing with Flood Element. It helps you scaffold a new project, then generate, write, validate, and run your scripts on your local machine. When you're ready, you can upload your test scripts to [Flood](https://flood.io) and be confident theyâ€™ll run exactly as expected, just like they did on your local machine.

:::info Choosing Yarn or NPM

We suggest using the Yarn package manager for better performance, however, each command has a compatible NPM equivelant.

## Global installation

First, make sure you have installed the [latest version of NodeJS](https://nodejs.org) for your platform (MacOS, Windows or Linux).

### 1.0 release

<a aria-label="NPM version" href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/element-cli/">
  <img alt="" src="https://img.shields.io/npm/v/element-cli.svg?style=for-the-badge&labelColor=000000&color=6554C0"/>
</a>

<Tabs
groupId="stable"
defaultValue="yarn"
values={[
{label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
{label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
]
}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash title="yarn"
# Install
yarn global add element-cli@1.0

# Verify installation
element --version
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```bash title="npm"
# Install
npm -g install element-cli@1.0

# Verify installation
element --version
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

This will install the latest stable version of Element CLI, together with other Element dependencies, globally on your machine.

## Local versioning

If you want to install a specific version of Element to use in a local project, just `cd` to the project folder, then install by adding a `@version-tag`, and removing the `global` (or `-g` on NPM) keyword.

<Tabs
groupId="specific-version"
defaultValue="yarn"
values={[
{label: 'Yarn', value: 'yarn'},
{label: 'NPM', value: 'npm'},
]
}>
<TabItem value="yarn">

```bash title="yarn"
# Install Element version 1.0.10
yarn add element-cli@1.0.10

# Verify installation
element --version
```

  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="npm">

```bash title="npm"
# Install Element version 1.0.10
npm install element-cli@1.0.10

# Verify installation
element --version
```

  </TabItem>
</Tabs>

Element is smart enough to detect whether you're using a custom version of Element locally or using the global install.

If you add element-cli to your local project `package.json`, Element will use that version, otherwise, it will default to your global version.

## Getting help

The Element CLI comes with built in help that details the commands and options available. Run:

```bash
element help
```

to see a list of commands and global the Element CLI supports. To get more detailed information about a specific command, and the options it accepts, pass it the `--help` flag.

For example, to learn more about the `run` command and the options you can pass in, run:

```bash
element run --help
```
